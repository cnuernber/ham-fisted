# 1.000-beta-18
 * expose sublistcheck.

# 1.000-beta-17
 * Stricter correctness checking for sublist types, everything implements Associative.

# 1.000-beta-16
 * Correctness fixes for pmap, upmap, pgroups, upgroups.

# 1.000-beta-15
 * Fixed sum for large n-elems.
 * upgroups - Unordered parallel groupings for random access systems.
 * Indexed consumers for copying, broadcasting type operations.
 * Reducible interface for objects that can reduce themselves.

# 1.000-beta-14
 * ArraySection is now first-class, will rebase dtype-next array pathways on this.

# 1.000-beta-12
 * pmap is guaranteed *not* to require `shutdown-agents`.
